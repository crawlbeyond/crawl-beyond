* What is Beyond?
  Beyond is a new endgame portal...

  Beyond is also represents a difficulty increase beyond ziggurats and the orb of zot...

  Beyond is something for player characters who have conquered all other game content. Beyond is a 729-floor endurance test and a place for the developers to pull out all the stops in their pursuit of outwitting the player. Beyond isn't about throwing tons of new 1-shot mechanics at the player (though expect to see some...); beyond is about adding complexity and depth to combat and player choices, especially gear options. Beyond is about forcing the player through an obstacle course and making them think on their feet, pushing them out of their comfort zone a bit, but also handing them the tools to handle the situation. Major encounters should be trials by fire. Expect use of "save point" mechanics or maybe even something like Dark Souls bonfires?..
